Shape Up hasn’t invented the concept of separation, but it made it clear when the crossing line goes in this specific methodology.</p> <p>If we take a look at different ways of producing the software, we may realize such stages:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Earlier in the process</th> <th>Later in the process</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Analyse &amp; Specify</td> <td>Design &amp; Develop &amp; Test &amp; Release</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Discovery</td> <td>Delivery</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Problem</td> <td>Solution</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Opportunity</td> <td>Solution</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Experiment</td> <td>Invest</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Shaping</td> <td>Building</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Refine</td> <td>Implement</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>No matter the religion. Phrases closer to the left-hand side are here to answer <strong>What we will build</strong>, while phrases on the right-hand side focus on <strong>Getting the solution done</strong>.</p> <p>The overlap of these two areas and the feedback frequency may differ depending on the methodology. <strong>The crossing line is the main difference between the methodologies</strong>. Think where the crossing line goes for your implementation of Shape Up.</p> <p>It is worth keeping the Shaping &amp; Building naming convention for Shape Up as it will enable people to look for it in a book. Using this naming convention will also positively influence most people by enabling them to work in a new fancy methodology.</p> <h2 id="explicit-separation-of-shaping-and-building">Explicit separation of Shaping and Building</h2> <p>When you start implementing the Shape Up, you need to understand the current state of Shaping and Building within’ your organization.</p> <p>In most companies, the whole Shaping process happens before something goes into Jira. Most engineers have no idea where the stories are coming from. If you want to learn how to visualize these stages, I encourage you to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmaDppWNBJc">Upstream Kanban by Radoslaw Orszewski</a>.</p> <p>In Shape Up, we want to raise awareness of the existence of the left-hand-side-phases for the Development Team / Builders. To do that, it is worth starting Shape Up implementation by explicit separation of Shaping and Building. This is the moment to let everyone know what these phrases mean and what they will look like.</p> <p>Make it clear and explain <em>What Shaping means?</em> and <em>What Building means?</em>. Also, share your expectations on <em>Who should participate in which phase?</em>.</p> <h2 id="usage-of-non-shape-up-methods">Usage of non-Shape Up methods</h2> <p>As there are many similarities in Discovery/Shaping - Delivery/Building processes in various methodologies; this is wise to use techniques popularized elsewhere.</p> <p>For both stages, you may use such the methods or at least take some inspiration from:</p> <ul> <li>Personas</li> <li>Competitive Analysis</li> <li>Unfair Advantage</li> <li>Customer Interviews, Surveys, Visits</li> <li>User Journey Mapping</li> <li>User Story Mapping</li> <li>Impact Mapping</li> <li>Event Storming</li> <li>Jobs-to-be-done</li> <li>Opportunity Solution Tree</li> <li>Mind Mapping</li> <li>Prototyping</li> <li>A/B Testing</li> <li>Value Stream Mapping</li> <li>MoSCoW</li> <li>Vertical Slices</li> <li>Increments</li> <li>Kickoff</li> <li>Planning</li> <li>… and many more.</li> </ul> <p>Just think twice and adjust it to your own needs within’ Shape Up.</p> <p>In the following article, we will answer the simple question <em><a href="https://rmakara.github.io/Shape-Up-Who-does-the-Shaping">Who does the Shaping?</a></em>.</p> </article> <div class="page-navigation code"> <a class="home" href="https://rmakara.github.io//" title="Back to Home">Back to Home</a> </div> </div> <div class="footer"> <span class="block">&copy; 2022 Rafal Makara</span> <span class="block"><small>&lt;/&gt; Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain">The Plain theme</a>.</small></span> </div> </body> </html>
