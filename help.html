When I started my commercial career, I was fortunate because I met a few people who believed in me and pushed me forward. I found out that supporting others gives me the same joy as my daily work. It also teaches me a lot.</p> <p>This is a list of ways I think I can help. If you see something here that might be useful to you, feel free to send me a LinkedIn friend invitation and a message.</p> <p>You do not need to ask for permission first. Get straight to the topic with your message.</p> <p>Do not worry. I am an introvert. You can use POLISH or ENGLISH. :)</p> <h1 id="ways-im-available-to-help-for-free">Ways I’m available to help for free</h1> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Answer concrete questions</strong> about topics I know. If you write me a message with a clear question, and I know the answer, I’ll try to answer. For very context-depended questions, I will try to approach them from a few angles. Responses will not be based on research but my experiences and current opinions. If I do not know the answer, then I will let you know about it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Put different perspectives on approaching the particular problem.</strong> If you explain the issue you are about to face, I will try to recommend methods, tools, or solutions worth trying. If I experienced similar cases in the past, I might share how I nailed/failed it. Please remember about your NDA and skip the details you cannot share.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brainstorm, support, and proofreading your very first article/blog post.</strong> If you want to improve your CV by writing an article or a blog post, I will be happy to help. We can have a call to speak about your ideas and make a brainstorming session to work on its content. I am not an SEO expert nor a great writer, but it will be an honor to read it before you publish it for a bigger audience.</p> </li> </ol> <h1 id="commercials">Commercials</h1> <p>If you are a Company and you would like me to support you in strategy, operations, organizational structure, software delivery, project management or Shape Up then please contact me <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafalmakara/">on LinkedIn</a>.</p> <h1 id="credits">Credits</h1> <p>Jacob Kaplan-Moss, who created a similar page, was an inspiration for me to make this one.
